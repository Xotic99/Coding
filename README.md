# About Me
I am a 15 year old boy who lives in Grand Blanc, Michigan in the USA and loves to code, the sections above are some coding languages I am learning or have learnt, and I as you might have seen there are some of my projects with images of what I have created with the different coding languages, and I use things like the Web development for classes, fun, or business when needed, but one thing I use Java for is a robotics Team I am on and it is our main language, in this group we use coding platforms like VSCode, Github, Intelij Idea, and there are some other softwares we use but these are the main 3 we use to make the code for our main bot and we use Vex Code 5 for our Vex bots when we are int hat season of competiton. I am hoping to keep learning and mabye even get a job as a programmer later on in life and I am always working to get my skills better and learn as much as I can and I hope to inspire other teens or anybody else who might want to pick up programming some projects they could do from begineer to advanced ever to mabye get them a job as a programmer. I am going to start doing YouTube posting coding tutorials and code with me livestreams that others can learn with me and mabye make blogs of things I am doing regarding classes and other things I do as personal projects. ("Link Goes Here") That is all from me and Here is my email for people who want to reach out ("Email Goes Here") also I have a discord which is great way to get in contact with me which is ("kishiyami") for adding me if you want to. Have a great day everybody and happy coding! :)
